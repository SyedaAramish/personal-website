      <p className="text-xl mb-10 max-w-3xl text-center leading-relaxed">
        I have been working on various projects to develop my skills, both as a problem solver and a creative thinker. Each project has given me an opportunity to learn new things, overcome challenges, and grow as a developer. My portfolio reflects my passion for coding, designing, and experimenting with new ideas. I have learned many valuable lessons from these little projects, and I look forward to whatâ€™s ahead.
